Painted Bird is the pick of the crop on this right side.\r\n\r\nRaven`s nest, despite some of it`s routes being less traveled is more than worthy of a sampling. Make sure to climb the mega classic Test of The Ironman. \r\n\r\nTeen wall is a huge 40 meter wall with some inspiring endurance routes. A short, angled slab at the base of the wall is the only drawback. If you are not too much of a purist and chipped holds don`t trigger you, make sure to check out the sustained and epic Air Test. In fact, almost every route one this wall has a healthy smattering of glue, enhancements, and manufactured pockets. If you put it in the back of your mind, the climbing offers awesome movement and lot of rock.\r\n\r\nWings Wall is a beautiful streaked wall with a lot offer. Wings of Desire is a mandatory tick, with a hotly debated grade.  Throw your vote in the hat whether it`s an 11b or 11c! It`s neighbors are some of the best 12 `s in all of Skaha. Despite being slightly overhung, don`t expect a techy cake-walk.
